title: Warming Up a Cold Christmas

The last time I visited Kashmir, it was for work. The month was November
and it was cold with night temperatures dropping below zero degrees. We
realized that without a heater it was impossible to sleep in this
freezing cold and hence decided to book a costlier hotel with adequate
heating facilities. The rooms were big and on one corner below the
windows there was a water heater which if you touched felt warm and
definitely not hot. It hardly affected the room temperature and we soon
realized it wasn't enough.

As we were exploring the possibilities of a blow heater beside the bed
which was located on the other end of the room and quite far from the
water heater, the hotel crew informed us in an assuring tone that there
was an under - blanket heater to warm the bed. The heat would be trapped
under the blanket and would keep us warm. I found two wires on either
side of the bed attached to two small temperature controllers each of
which had a switch that one could scroll up for max heating and down to
switch off. The heater which looked like a very thin blanket was placed
under the bed sheet.

After finishing the day's work, and with a lot of tiredness I went to
bed switching on the under - blanket heaters and pulled the blanket over
me. In about 7-10 mins the bed warmed up. I cannot explain how luxurious
it felt to have a heated mattress underneath and a blanket over me
trapping that heat.

In the morning I was so excited that I shared with Deepayan how great
the experience was and even he (despite being very well informed about
gadgets in general) admitted that he heard about it for the first time!

As usual, for work, I have been travelling in the month of December
too, though this is the time I really feel like holidaying not only
because of the weather but also because of the wonderful memories I
have of Christmas eves, Christmas Carols, Santa clause sending gifts
inside socks, parties, friends, bells and stars and home. 

Yesterday when I came back home from a series of tours I got two
surprise gifts... as I climbed onto my side of the bed in 7 degrees C,
under an already laid out blanket, I was touched with the same warmth
I had experienced in Kashmir! Yes indeed there was an under - blanket
heater underneath!  Today morning I was handed a pen drive with new
albums of songs for our car as I love to play music in the car when I
am travelling. While returning from work in the cold misty evening, I
turned on the player and Christmas Carols by one of my most favourite
groups from my childhood, Boney M, started playing! And it played, "I
played my drum for him pa rum pum pum pum, I played my best for him pa
rum pum pum pum..."

Merry Christmas!
