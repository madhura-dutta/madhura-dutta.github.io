Eight years back, right after I got married to an arranged husband,
within fifteen days of tying the knot, we went to Seattle - the city
where Deepayan was based in at that time. He chose British Airways and
the route was via Heathrow so that Seattle would be our first landing in
the USA. Anticipating that we would have more luggage than an ISI
Kolkata newlywed guy would like, the plan was made this way to avoid
domestic flight travel within USA. It took us almost 23 hours to reach
his lake-facing studio apartment in Seattle from Kolkata.

I was wrapped in tiredness from the long journey which made it easier to
land in an unknown apartment, with an unknown person, in an unknown
city, in an unknown country. There was no expectation and no
contemplation but just giving in to the situation.

I remember we had reached in the evening and after a bath we had gone
out to get dinner from a small road side shop called Eastlake Teriyaki.
I heard Deepayan ordering something which did not register because my
senses were blurred by the cold and numbness. The man on the other side
of the counter said "to go?" and Deepayan nodded. I remember I had
asked what the phrase meant as it was new to me then!

I don't remember when and how I went to sleep that night. When I woke
up probably at four in the morning it was still dark outside and the
only sense that was triggered was the smell of a brilliant coffee. I
turned and looked up and found Deepayan reclined beside me with a
steaming great smelling cup of coffee.

I woke up that morning to nothing... no work, no job, no planning, no
life, no known emotions, but just a cup of coffee. The first sip
prepared me for the unknown and I sank into it. How I wish I could wake
up to that feeling of "unknown" just one more time!
